### 10 create Vectors and matrics

- transpose()
- ones()
- zeros()
- rand
- randn


row vectors
``` vect= [1 2 3 4 2 3 1 ]```

column vectors 

``` vect= [1;2;3;4;2;3;1]```

make a column vector by transposing a row vector

``` vect= [1 2 3 4 2 3 1 ]'```

``` vect= transpose([1 2 3 4 2 3 1 ])'```

make a row vector of ones

``` ones(4)```

column vector of .25

``` vect = ones(8, 1) * .25```

``` vect = zeors(8, 1) + .25```

random number

``` mart = randn(4, 3)```
``` mart = rand(4, 3)```
